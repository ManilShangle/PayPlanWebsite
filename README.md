# PayPlan – Take Control of Your BNPL Payments

PayPlan is a Chrome extension designed to help Gen Z and other users track and manage Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) purchases.  
It automatically detects BNPL confirmation screens, extracts payment details, and visualizes upcoming payments on an interactive calendar.  
The extension also syncs seamlessly with Google Calendar for easy reminders, helping users avoid missed payments and better understand their spending.
